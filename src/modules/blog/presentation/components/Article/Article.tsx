                <p> Your bathroom serves a string of busy functions on a daily basis. See how you can make all of them work, and still have room for comfort and relaxation. </p>
                <h3>A cleaning hub with built-in ventilation</h3>
                <p>Use a rod and a shower curtain to create a complement to your cleaning cupboard. Unsightly equipment is stored out of sight yet accessibly close – while the air flow helps dry any dampness.</p>
            </div>
            <img alt={'img'} src={img2}></img>
            <div>
                <h3> Storage with a calming effect</h3>
                <p>Having a lot to store doesn’t mean it all has to go in a cupboard. Many bathroom items are better kept out in the open – either to be close at hand or are nice to look at. Add a plant or two to set a calm mood for the entire room (and they’ll thrive in the humid air).</p>
                <h3>Kit your clutter for easy access</h3>
                <p>Even if you have a cabinet ready to swallow the clutter, it’s worth resisting a little. Let containers hold kits for different activities – home spa, make-up, personal hygiene – to bring out or put back at a moment’s notice.</p>
            </div>
            <img alt={'img'} src={img3}></img>
            <h3> Make your mop disappear </h3>
            <p>Having your cleaning tools organized makes them easier to both use and return to. When they’re not needed, close the curtain and feel the peace of mind it brings.</p>
